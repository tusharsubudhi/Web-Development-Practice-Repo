    <pre>Writing applications are necessary for official works and school management records.

        Many students find it difficult to write an application because of a lack of information about the basic format to follow while writing an application. 
        
        Here is the basic format of a formal application for a leave of two days:
        
        To,
        
        The principal,
        
        (School name),
        
        (School address),
        
        City.
        
        Subject: Application for Two daysâ€™ leave.
        
        Dear Sir/Madam,
        
        With due respect, I want to state that I am a student of Class 5th (say) in your school. I have an emergency because I need to leave the town and stay out of the station for two days, i.e., 8th, June 2021 and 9th, June 2021 (say). So I will not be able to attend any classes during that period, and hence, I want to apply for leave for these two days. All my work is up to date, and I will cover the rest after returning.
        
        Kindly grant me leave for two days ( 8th, June 2021 & 9th, June 2021). It will be really helpful to me. Thank you in advance for your consideration and cooperation in this matter.
        
        Thanking you,
        
        Yours obediently,
        
        (Name)
        
        (Class)
        
        (Roll no.)
        
        (Date)</pre>
